function[acv] = autocov(X,Y)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% autocov computes the autocovariance between two column vectors X and Y
% with same length N using the Fast Fourier Transform algorithm from 0 to
% N-2.
% The resulting autocovariance column vector acv is given by the formula:
% acv(p,1) = 1/(N-p) * \sum_{i=1}^{N} (X_{i} - X_bar) * (Y_{i+p} - Y_bar)
% where X_bar and Y_bar are the mean estimates: 
% X_bar = 1/N * \sum_{i=1}^{N} X_{i}; Y_bar = 1/N * \sum_{i=1}^{N} Y_{i}
% It satisfies the following identities:
% 1. variance consistency: if acv = autocov(X,X), then acv(1,1) = var(X)
% 2. covariance consistence: if acv = autocov(X,Y), then acv(1,1) = cov(X,Y)
